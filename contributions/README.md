# Contributions

This folder will contain, in the `contributions` branch, user contributions to be merged into the database.

Each set of contributions will be contained in a folder named `YYYY-MM-DD-username` corresponding to the contribution date and the contributor. The format of the files is similar to that in the [`objects`](../objects/) folder, except that only the changed fields are listed.
